## About Me

I’m zS1m, a software engineer interested in web engineering, systems, and long-term project design.
I enjoy working on real-world projects, where constraints, trade-offs, and imperfect decisions are part of everyday engineering.

## About This Site

This blog collects engineering notes from projects I build and maintain over time.
Rather than step-by-step tutorials, most articles focus on **production issues, architectural decisions, and lessons learned** during development.

## Why “Contrails”

Contrails are traces left behind by movement — subtle, temporary, but meaningful.
In a similar way, this site serves as a record of ideas, experiments, and engineering paths taken along the way.
